1) Get a list of all words in english

2) Filter the list to get words of length 5

3) Assign each word a score (Based on the number of unique letters in the word) [This is initially stored in the form of a dictionary, with words being the key and scores being the values]

Example: 
    score("batman") = 5
    score("driver") = 5
    score("sheep") = 4

4) Convert the data from the dictionary to a nested list again

dict = {
    "batman":5,
    "driver":5,
    "sheep":4
}

nes_list = [
    ("batman",5),
    ("driver",5),
    ("sheep",4)
]

5) sort the list based on the score of the item in descending order (the nes_list is already sorted)

6) With this the preprocessing step is over, and we can move on to making guesses


7) The machine will give the top-most word as it's guess i.e "batman"

8) we provide a feedback to the machine which indicates the presence and absence of certain letters from it's guess.

+  - letter present at the exact location

. - letter not present in the word

* - letter present in the word


9) The machine will use that feedback to filter in only those words that match the criteria

10) step 7, 8 and 9 repeats
